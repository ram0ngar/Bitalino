Contains the BITalino C# SDK as well as a three projects developed under Unity3D and implementing the C# SDK.
We developed those projects to test the viability of BITalino under Unity3D, as well as our C# SDK.

* Organization

There are three scenes:
Demo: which display the ToString() of the frames read.
Graph: which display the Graph of the frames read.
SuperCopter: a basic application using the luminosity of the room. After the calibration, change the luminosity of BITalino's surrounding to avoid missiles.
